## Tree file foramt:
# Each line in this file specifies a partition of the data set that is to be simulated.
# The partition of the data set is simulated along the tree.
# Each line contains three items separated by spaces:
# 1. A scale factor of the tree. Usually this has a value of 1, which means that the branch lengths are used
# as they appear in the tree
# 2. The partion size (in bp).
# 3. The root model
# 4. Tree in newick format, which is allowed to contain special comments in the form [&xxx], where xxx is a model name
#    that is specified in the model file. The special comments can be placed behind the branch length and are interpreted to
#    change the model to the one specified when getting in this branch.
#
# Example of one partition of size 10000
1.0  20 Model_JC ((A:0.1,B:0.9):0.005,(C:0.1,D:0.9):0.005)

# For this tree Maximimum parsimony will almost certainly reconstruct the wrong tree while Maximum Likelihood should have a high probablility of reconstructing the correct tree.
