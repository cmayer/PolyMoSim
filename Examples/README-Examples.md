# PolyMoSim examples:

PolyMoSim can be used in a variety of ways.
Here we want to provide some examples how it can be used:

The following folders contain different examples. The purpose of these examples is mostly
self explanatory. 

## Example-1_tree-in-Felsenstein-zone

Simulate a datasets on four taxon trees with a short internal branch such that methods like Maximum Parsimony are guaranteed to reconstruct the wrong phylogenetic tree. 

## Example-2_two-partitions

Simulate an alignment with two partitions.

## Example-3_aa-models

Simulation using amino acid models.

## Example-4_standard-heterotachy

Simulation producing an alignment with two partitions, simulating the standard heterotachy scenario.

## Example-5_different-models-on-different-lineages

Simulations using different models on different lineages of the tree.

## Example-6_free-siterate-distribution__remove_in_dist

Simulations using free rate models for the sequence evolution.

## Example-7_heterotachy2__remove_in_dist



## Example-for-sitepattern

Simulations that use site pattern frequencies as output format.
