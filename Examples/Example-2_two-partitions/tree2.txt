## Tree file foramt:
# Each line in this file specifies a partition of the data set that is to be simulated.
# The partition of the data set is simulated along the tree.
# Each line contains three items separated by spaces:
# 1. A scale factor of the tree. Usually this has a value of 1, which means that the branch lengths are used
# as they appear in the tree
# 2. The partion size (in bp).
# 3. The root model
# 4. Tree in newick format, which is allowed to contain special comments in the form [&xxx], where xxx is a model name
#    that is specified in the model file. The special comments can be placed behind the branch length and are interpreted to
#    change the model to the one specified when getting in this branch.
#
# "Mixed up trees". Simulates two genes under different gene trees.
# Partition sizes differ and are 10000 and 1000 bp. Note that the trees and models differ on the two partitions.
