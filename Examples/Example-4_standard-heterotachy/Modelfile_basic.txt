## Example model file for Multimoseqsim:
##
## Put comments into your model file with the aid of the '#' character.
## If a '#' character occurs in a line of your model file, the remainder of
## the line will be ignored my Multimoseqsim.
## Here we will use comments do describe the model file format.

## List of allowed nucleotide modeltypes: JC, F81, K2P, F84, HKY, GTR
## All other nucleotide substitution models need to be specified as special cases of these models.

## Model file format:
begin model       # (required) Indicates the start of a new nucleotide model
name: Modell_JC   # (required) Give each model a unique name. A name can be composed of characters,
                  #            numbers and underscores.
modeltype: JC     # (required) The model type. A list of implemneted models is given above.    
end model         # (required) Indicates the end of the model

begin model
name: Modell_JC_shape_01
modeltype: JC
shape: 0.1        # (not required) If a shape parameter is specified, gamma distributed site rates 
                  # are assumed. Of no heterogeneity is specified, site rates are homogeneious.
pinv:  0.3        # proportion of invariant sites
end model

begin model
name: Modell_K2P_2
modeltype: K2P
tstv: 2          # Transition transversion ratio
end model

begin model
name: Modell_HKY
modeltype: HKY
tstv: 3         
basefreq: 0.2  0.3  0.2  0.3  # base frequencies
end model

begin model

modeltype: GTR
rrates: 2 10 3 1 11 1       # relative substitution rates in the order: 
                            # A->C,A->G,A->T,C->G,C->T,G->T
                            # These rates will be normalized automatically.
