# Simulation on tree with long terminal branches and different base frquencies:
# Evolution is governed by JC model. On two terminal branches, we have a base frequency bias
# cased by a different model on these branches:
1.0  20000 Modell_JC ((A:0.8[&Modell_F81],B:0.8):0.01,(C:0.8[&Modell_F81],D:0.8):0.01)

# Branchlengths and model deviation are quite strong, which is necessary to get methods on the 
# wrong track.
