# PolyMoSim
Nucleotide and amino acid phylogenetic sequence alignment simulator

PolyMoSim is a program to simulate the evolution of sequences on a phylogenetic tree and the possibiliy to have different evolutionary models on a tree as well as multiple partitions. 

It has a variety of output formats including fasta, phylix, nexus and pattern frequencies. The latter are useful for training machine learning models for evolutionary model prediction as well as for topology prediction.
